# OwlHook

This project is to build an injectable dll on windows 10 64bit (only current supported architecture). It has no real features as of now, only includes a ghost client base, menu (with incomplete widgets, and color customization), config system, as well as button to unload from memory. Use at your own risk, this isn't allowed on most minecraft servers (obviously). **This is incomplete, and probably not very good c++. But, runs fast, efficient, and stable in minecraft with no memory leaks.**

This is lisenced under GPL v3.0, read before using for anything non-personal. I will sue.

# Why?

I had some trouble initially figuring out how to make something like this, and I wanted to add an example for anyone else. Also, Maybe it will encourage more people to make free/opensource ghost clients. I hate how basically auto clickers built into things like this are selling for ranging prices, but sometimes up in the $40-50 range. It is dumb to buy, make your own or use a free one.

# Compiling

This should me almost compileable out of the box (visual studio 2022). You only (should) need to add glew-2.1.0, and glfw-3.3.6.bin.WIN64 folders into C:\Include, or reconfig it yourself in the solution explorer. If you have any trouble create an issue I will try to help.
